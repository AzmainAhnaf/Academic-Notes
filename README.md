# How to get started

You can download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download). Download the whole semester file \(which is provided in RAR/ZIP format) and export the folder as a vault to Obsidian, and you are good to go.
Or you can download or read the PDF version of the markdown file \(if available\).

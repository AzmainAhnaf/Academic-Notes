# Software

- The programs (instructions) that tells the computer what to do
- Computer hardware is useless without software
- Computer software is the set of programs that makes the hardware perform a set of tasks in particular order
- Software is developed by writing instructions in programming language
- Software is affected by computer viruses
- It is loaded into a computer's storage (such as hard drive, a memory, or RAM). Once the software is loaded, the computer is able to execute the software in the Central Processing Unit

## System Software

- System software is a term referring to any computer software which manages and controls the hardware so that application software can perform a task
- Manages the fundamental operations of the computer, such as
	- loading programs and data into memory
	- executing programs
	- saving data to disks
	- displaying information on the monitor
	- transmitting data through a port to a peripheral device
- Without systems software installed in our computers we would have to type the instructions for everything we wanted the computer to do
- Examples of System Software
	- Utility software
	- System servers
	- Device drivers
	- Operating system (OS)
	- Windows/graphical user interface (GUI) systems
	- Microsoft windows

### Features of System Software
- close to system
- fast in speed
- difficult to design
- difficult to understand
- less interactive
- smaller in size
- difficult to manipulate
- generally written in low level language


## Operating Systems

- Operating system is a software, which makes a computer to actually work
- Collection of computer programs that control the interaction of the user and the computer hardware
- Responsible for directing all computer operations and managing all computer resources
- Controls basic input and output, allocates system resources, manages storage space, maintain security, and detects equipment failure.
- A part of the operating system code is stored in a ROM and the rest of it resides on a disk

![[Pasted image 20250204224040.png]]

- Examples: Windows, Linux, Unix and Mac OS etc.


### Responsibilities of an OS

- Communicate with user, receive and execute commands, show error messages
- Manage allocation of memory, processor time and other resources
- Collect input from keyboard, mouse, and provide data to running programs
- Convey program output to screen, printer, or other output device
- Access data from secondary storage
- Write data to secondary storage
- Maintains security (checks user-name, password, virus infection)


## Gadget Drivers

- This kind of software controls specific hardware which is basically connected to system
- A driver provides a software interface to hardware devices, enabling operating systems and other computer programs to access hardware functions without needing to know precise details about the hardware being used

- Show Drivers
- ROM Drivers
- Printer Drivers
- USB Drivers
- Sound Card Drivers
- VGA Drivers


# Firmware

- Firmware is a software program permanently etched into a hardware device such as keyboards, hard drive, BIOS, or video cards. It is programmed to give permanent instructions to communicate with other devices and perform functions like basic input/output tasks
- The firmware is a special type of software that helps to control device's hardware
- Inserted Systems
- UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
- Profiles
- PC Peripherals

# Utility

- Utility software is software designed to help to analyze, configure, optimize or maintain a computer
- It is sued to support the computer infrastructure - in contrast to application software, which is aimed at directly performing tasks that benefit ordinary users
- McAfee Antivirus
- WinRAR
- WinZip
- Piriform CCleaner
- Windows File Explorer
- Registry Opus
- Razer Cortex
- Norton Antivirus


# Application Software

- Application software, or simply applications, are often called productivity programs or end-user programs because they enable the user to complete tasks.
- Application software is specific to the task it is designed for and can be as simple as a calculator application or as complex as a word processing application
- Software that can perform a specific task for the user, such as word processing, accounting, budgeting or payroll, fall under the category of application software
- Examples
	- Word Processing Software: The main purpose of this software is to produce documents
	- MS Word
	- Apple iWork-Pages
	- Corel WordPerfect
	- Google Docs
	- Presentation Software: This software is used to display the information in the form of slide who. The three main functions of presentation software is
		- Allows insertion and formatting of text
		- Including graphics in the text
		- Executing the slide shows
	- Multimedia Software: Media players and real players are the examples of multimedia software. This software will allow the user to create audio and videos.
	- Sight and Sound Software: This is software which can play, make just as record pictures, sound or even video documents. These software are used for liveliness, video altering, illustrations just as picture altering. Because of popularity for such software, each software item improvement organization has huge roads in creating the. A portion of instances of such software are:
		- Adobe Photoshop
		- Picasa
		- VLC Media Player
		- Windows Media Player
		- Windows Movie Maker
	- Spread Sheet Software: The spread sheet software is used to maintain budget, financial statements, grade sheets, and sales records
	- Internet Browsers: These software are used to peruse web. Internet browsers help clients in situating just as recovering information well over web
		- Google Chrome
		- Mozilla Firefox
		- Web Explorer
		- Drama
		- UC Browser
		- Safari
	- Database Management Systems (DBMS)
		- A DBMS is a software tool that allows multiple user to store, access, and process data into useful information
			- The purpose of this software is to organize and manage data
			- The advantage of this software is that you can change the way data is stored and displayed
		- Database programs are designed for these types of applications
			- Membership lists
			- Student lists
			- Grade reports
			- Instructor Schedules
		- All of these have to be maintained so you can find what you need quickly and accurately
		- Example
			- MS Access
			- FileMaker
			- dBase
			- Scissors
			- MySQL
			- FoxPro



# Software Engineering

- Software engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design, development and maintenance of software. Software engineering was introduced to address the issues of low-quality software projects.
- Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of quality. It ensures that the application is built consistently, correctly, on time and on budget and within requirements.

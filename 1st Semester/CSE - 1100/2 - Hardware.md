# Counting

People start counting around 40,000 years ago using stone-like items

After that Tally mark was created

## Represent Number using Number System

The earlies known number system date back thousands of years, and include:

- Samaria: Around 3400 BC, the Sumerians invented the first known numeral system and a system of weights and measures.
- Egypt: Around 3100 BC. Egypt introduced the earliest known decimal system, which allowed for indefinite counting.
- Indus Valley Civilization: Around 2800 BC. the Indus Valley civilization used decimal ratios in their weights and measures
- Mesopotamia: Around 2000 BC, the Babylonians used a base-60 decimal system


In modern days, the main number systems are,

- Binary (Base-2)
- Octal (Base-8)
- Decimal (Base-10)
- Hexadecimal (Base-16)


# Computer

A machine that can compute is called computer.

What about computing?

Here are some computational operation:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Division
4. Multiplication

![[Pasted image 20250204201459.png|200]]



## Generation of Computers

### First Generation Computers (1946 - 1959)

- Uses vacuum tubes
- slow, huge and expensive

![[Pasted image 20250204201905.png]]

- Examples
	- ENIAC (Electronic Numeral Integrator and Computer)
	- EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer)
	- UNIVACI (Universal Automatic Computer)
	- IBM-701
	- IBM-650



### Second Generation Computers (1959 - 1965)

- Uses transistor
- Cheap, compact, and consume less power

![[Pasted image 20250204202046.png]]

- Examples
	- IBM 1620
	- IBM 7094
	- CDC 1604
	- CDC 3600
	- UNIVAC 1108



### Third Generation Computers (1965 - 1971)

- Used integrated Circuits (ICs)
	- An IC contains tiny transistors on a silicon wafer
- Increased the power of compute and reduced the cost

![[Pasted image 20250204202342.png]]

- Examples
	- IBM-360 series
	- Honeywell-6000 series
	- PDP (Personal Data Processor)
	- IBM-370/168
	- TDC-316


### Fourth Generation Computers (1971 - 1980)

- Used very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits
- More compact, powerful, fast and affordable

![[Pasted image 20250204202509.png]]

- Examples
	- DEC 10
	- STAR 1000
	- PDP 11
	- CRAY-1 (Super Computer)
	- CRAY-X-MP (Super Computer)



### Fifth Generation Computers  (1980 - )

- Uses ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) Circuits

![[Pasted image 20250204202913.png]]

- Example
	- Desktop
	- Laptop
	- NoteBook

## Types of Computers

On the basis purpose, computer can be divided into two categories

- General Purpose Computer
- Special Purpose Computer


### General Purpose Computer

A general-purpose computer is a computer that is designed to be able to carry out many different tasks. Example: Desktop, Laptop


### Special Purpose Computer

Special-purpose computers are designed for one specific task or class of tasks and wouldn't be able to perform general computing tasks. Examples: Router, Server, TV, ATM machine


On the basis of data handling capabilities, computer can be divided into three categories

- Analogue Computer
- Digital Computer
- Hybrid Computer


### Analogue Computer

An analog computer or analogue computer is a type of computer that uses the continuous variation aspect of physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities (analog signals) to model the problem being solved

Examples: Operational amplifies, mechanical integrators, slide rules, tide predictors, electric integrators.


### Digital Computer

Digital computer, any of a class of devices capable of solving problems by processing information in discrete form.

Examples: Personal Computer/Laptops/NoteBooks, Smartphones/tables, Digital Weighing Machine, Automated Teller Machine - ATM, Calculators



### Hybrid Computer

Hybrid computers are computers that exhibit features of analog computers and digital computers

Examples; Electrocardiogram Machine, Ultrasound Machine, Monitoring Machine



On the basis of size, computer can be divided into five categories

- Supercomputer
- Mainframe Computer
- Minicomputer
- Workstation
- PC (Personal Computer)


### Supercomputer

A supercomputer is a computer with a high level of performance compared to a general-purpose computer

Examples: Belle, Deep Blue, and Hydra for playing chess


### Mainframe Computer

A mainframe computer, informally called a mainframe or big iron, is a computer used primarily by large organizations for critical applications like bulk data processing for tasks such as censuses, industry and consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning, and large-scale transaction processing.

Examples: ENIAC (Electric Numerical Integrator and Calculator), UNIVAC, ASCC (Automatic Sequence Control Computer)


### Minicomputer

minicomputer, computer that was smaller, less expensive, and less powerful than a mainframe or supercomputer but more expensive and more powerful than a personal computer. Minicomputers were used for scientific and engineering computations, business transactions processing, file handling, and database management



### Workstation

Workstation, a high-performance computer system that is basically designed for a single user and has advanced graphics capabilities, large store capacity, and a powerful central processing unit



### PC (Personal Computer)/ Microcomputer

A personal computer (PC) is a multipurpose microcomputer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use.

# Experiment 2
## Verification of Ohm's Law

Ohm's law states that, in constant temperature, the electric current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points
$$
V \propto I
$$
$$
Or,\ V = IR
$$


# Experiment 3
## Verification of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)


Kirchhoff's Voltage Law states that, the sum of all voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero
$$
\sum V = 0
$$



# Experiment 4
## Verification of Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)

Kirchhoff's Current Law states that, the algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or junction) in an electrical circuit is equal to zero.
$$
\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out} \ \ \ \ \ \ \sum_{k=1}^n I_k = 0
$$



# Experiment 5
## Verification of Thevenin's Theorem

Thevenin's Theorem states that, any linear electrical circuit with voltage sources, current sources, and resistances can be replaced by an equivalent circuit of a single voltage source in series with a single resistance connected to a load.



# Experiment 6
## Verification of Maximum Power Transfer Theorem

The Maximum Power Transfer Theorem states that, a load receives maximum power from a source when the load resistance is equal to the internal resistance of the source (or the Thevenin equivalent resistance)

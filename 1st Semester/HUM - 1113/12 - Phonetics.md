# What is IPA?

- **International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)** is an alphabetic system of phonetic notation developed in the late 19th century to accurately represent the pronunciation of languages
- It was devised by the International Phonetic Association as a standardized representation of speech sounds in written form
- The IPA primarily uses Roman characters. Other letters are borrowed from different scripts (e.g., Greek) and are modified to conform to Roman style
- Diacritics are used for fine distinctions in sounds and to show nasalization of vowels, length, stress, and tones
- One of the aims of the IPA is to provide a unique symbol for each distinctive sounds in a language --- that is, every sound, or phoneme, that servers to distinguish one word from another.
- To standardize the representation of spoken language, thereby sidestepping the confusion caused by the inconsistent conventional spellings used in every language
- To supersede the existing multitude of individual transcription systems.
- IPA symbols are composed of one or more elements of two basic types, letters and diacritics. For example, the sound of the English letter "t" may be transcribe in IPA with a single letter, \[t], or with a letter plus diacritics, \[$t^{h}$], depending on how precise one wishes to be.



# Vowel

- A vowel is a speech sound for whose production the oral passage of air is unobstructed ---so that the air current can flow from lungs to the lips and beyond, without being stopped, without having to squeeze through a narrow construction, without being deflected from the median line of its channel, and without causing any of the supraglottic organs to vibrate.
- In other words, vowels are defined, in terms of phonetics, as the speech sounds in the production of which there is ---in the pharynx and mouth ---no obstruction or narrowing of a degree that would cause audible friction. Vowels are typically, but not necessarily, voiced
- Note: In terms of their function in a given language, however, some of the sounds determined in phonetic terms as vowels may be regarded as consonants. Such is the case with the initial sounds in English words 'yes' and 'wet', for example.


## Monophthongs / Pure Vowels

- The vowels ---during the production of which the position of the tongue remains unchanged ---are called a pure vowel or monophthong. There are twelve monophthongs in English.

## Diphthongs

- Diphthong signifies the combination of two vowel sounds
- The word 'diphthong' takes its origin from Greek 'di' meaning two, and 'phthong' meaning sound.
- When a cluster of two vowels ---being pronounced side by side ---produces one vowel sound, it is called a diphthong.
- In other words, the sounds that consist of a movement or glide from one vowel to another are called diphthongs.
- In a diphthong, the first part of the combined vowel sound is much longer and stronger than the later. And a diphthong occupies a single syllable. There are eight diphthongs in English.

## Triphthongs

- The most complex English sounds of the vowel type are the triphthongs
- Very difficult to pronounce
- Very difficult to recognize
- Triphthong is a glide from one vowel to another and then to a third, all produced rapidly and without interruption
- Triphthongs can be looked on as being composed of the following five diphthongs with another phoneme added on the end

# Phonetics Vs. Phonology


| Phonetics                                                                                      | Phonology                                                                                                                                                             |

| In phonetics, we discuss physical production of speech sounds                                  | In phonology, we study concepts of sounds of a language and focuses on the organization of sounds by studying speech patterns                                         |
| Phonetics simply describes the articulatory, auditory and acoustic properties of speech sounds | Phonology studies how speech sounds combine and how they change in combination, as well as sounds change in a word, can contrast to produce the difference in meaning |
| Phonetics comes under descriptive linguistics                                                  | Phonology comes under theoretical linguistics                                                                                                                         |
| Phonetics studies the production, transmission, and reception of sounds                        | Phonology studies different patterns of sounds in different languages                                                                                                 |
| Phonetics is physics of sound                                                                  | Phonology is psychology of sound                                                                                                                                      |
| Phonetics does not deal with one particular language but all sounds in general                 | In phonology, we study sounds of a specific language                                                                                                                  |
| Phonetical units are called phones                                                             | Phonological unites are called phonemes                                                                                                                               |
| Phonetic symbols are enclosed in square brackets as **\[f], \[m]**, etc.                       | Phonemic symbols are enclosed in slash marks as **/f/, /m/,** etc.                                                                                                    |
| It studies how many speech sounds a language has                                               | It deals with the system and patter of speech sounds in a language                                                                                                    |
| Sounds can be divided into consonants and vowels                                               | can be characterized according to place, manner of articulation, and voice (voiceless or voiced)                                                                      |

# Structure of a Paragraph

A paragraph consists of 3 parts. Topic sentence, supporting details and concluding sentence.
The topic sentence is the whole idea of the paragraph and we should brainstorm about what can we write on the topic sentence. Supporting details is the part where we elaborate and justify our topic sentence. The concluding sentence conclude the paragraph by restating the topic sentence.

5. Explanation
6. Concluding Sentence

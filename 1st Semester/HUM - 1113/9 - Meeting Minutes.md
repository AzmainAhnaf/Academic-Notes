# What is a Meeting

Formal or informal deliberative assembly of individuals called to debate certain issues and problems, and to take decisions. Formal meetings are held at definite ties, at a definite place, and usually for a definite duration to follow an agreed upon agenda.



# What is Minutes

**Minutes** also known as **minutes of meeting** or, informally, **notes**, are the instant written record of a meeting or hearing. They typically describe the events of the meeting and may include a list of attendees, a statement of the issues considered by the participants, and related responses or decisions for the issues



# What is Agenda

Ordered sequence of items to be discussed in a formal meeting. The objectives of any agenda include to

- familiarize participants with the topics to be discussed and issues to be raised
- Indicate what prior knowledge would be expected from the participant
- Indicate what outcome the participant may expect from the meeting



# What is Action

Action items are usually created during a discussion by a group of people who are meeting about one or more topics and during the discussion it is discovered that some kind of action is needed. The act required is then documented as an action item and usually assigned to someone, usually a member of the group. The person to whom the action is assigned is then obligated to perform the action and report back to the group on the results



# What needs to be included

When you are writing meeting minutes you need to include different kinds of information. Here's a list of what needs to be included in effective meeting minutes:

- Date, time and location of the meeting
- The purpose of the meeting
- Names of attendees and those who were unable to attend
- Agenda items
- Decisions that were made
- Actions that need to be done. Include the deadline and who it was assigned to
- Follow up meeting

Prepare your meeting minutes by writing down the things you know beforehand, like date, time, location, purpose and agenda items. This way you will only have to add the things you discussed, like the outcome of the meeting



# Importance

Although it may seem like writing meeting minutes can take a lot of time, they will, in fact, help you save time and money. Meeting minutes provide a written record of what was discussed and agreed at a meeting, so you and your colleagues will have the same recollections from the meeting and the same ideas about what was agreed. With good meeting minutes, you make sure everyone knows what was decided and what needs to be achieved by what date.

## Standardization of Sodium Hydroxide ($NaOH$) Solution by titration against a standardized solution of Hydrochloric Acid ($HCl$)

### Introduction

According to Bronsted-Lowry,
**Acid:** Acid is the chemical species which donates proton to other chemical species.
**Base:** Base is the chemical species which accepts proton from another chemical species.
$$
Na_2CO_3 + 2HCl \longrightarrow 2NaCl + H_2O + CO_2
$$
$$
NaOH + HCl \longrightarrow NaCl + H_2O
$$
$HCl$ is an acid, $Na_2CO_3$ and $NaOH$ are base.


**Neutralizing Reaction:**  The chemical reaction involved in acid-base titration is known as neutralizing reaction.

**Acidimetry:** The estimation of an alkali solution using a standard acid solution is called acidimetry

**Alkalimetry**: The estimation of an acid solution using a standard alkali solution is called alkalimetry


### Principle

**Why is $HCl$ a secondary standard substance?** 
$HCl$ is a secondary standard substance as it absorbs moisture from air and it cannot be obtained perfectly free from water.

### Experimental Procedure

**Steps of the Practical**

after adding Methyl Orange the solution was pink and at the end point color changes to yellow for both titration.


# Practical 2

## Standardization of approximately 0.1N Potassium Permanganate ($KMnO_4$) solution by titration against a standard solution of Oxalic Acid (0.1N) ($H_2C_2O_4$)

### Introduction & Principle

**Oxidation-Reduction / redox reaction:** Oxidation-Reduction is the chemical reaction in which electron is transferred from one species to another.

**Oxidation reaction:**  The reaction in which electron is lost is called oxidation reaction

**Reduction reaction:** The reaction in which electron is gained is called reduction reaction

**Reducing agent:** Chemical species which loses its electron in redox reaction is called the reducing agent

**Oxidizing agent:** Chemical species which gain electron in redox reaction is called the oxidizing agent

**Reaction of this experiment:**
$$
2KMnO_4 + 5H_2C_2O_4 + 3H_2SO_4 = K_2SO_4 + 2MnSO_4 + 10CO_2 + 8H_2O
$$

**Identify the oxidation-half reaction and reduction half reaction in the following reactions**

- $2Na + Cl_2 = 2NaCL$ 
	$2Na - 2e = 2Na^+$ (oxidation reaction, $Na$ is reducing agent)
	$Cl_2 + 2e = 2Cl^-$ (reduction reaction, $Cl_2$ is oxidizing agent)
- $2Fe^{3+} + Sn^{2+} = 2Fe^{2+} + Sn^{4+}$
	$Sn^{2+} - 2e = Sn^{4+}$ (oxidation reaction, $Sn^{2+}$ is reducing agent)
	$2Fe^{3+} + 2e = 2Fe^{2+}$ (reduction reaction, $Fe^{3+}$ is oxidizing agent)
- $2KMnO_4 + 5H_2C_2O_4 + 3H_2SO_4 = K_2SO_4 + 2MnSO_4 + 10CO_2 + 8H_2O$ 
	$C_2O_4^{2-} - 2e = 2CO_2$ (oxidation reaction)
	$MnO_4^- + 8H^+ 5e = Mn_{2+} + 8H_2O$ (reduction reaction)


### Experimental Procedure

**Pure oxalic acid exists in which form?**
Crystalline dihydrate form as $H_2C_2O_4.2H_2O$ 

**Molecular and equivalent weight of oxalic acid in crystalline dihydrate form**
MW = $126$
EW = $\frac {126}2 = 63$

**How to get the desired solution of oxalic acid for titration?**
$$
normality = \frac{w \times 1000}{E \times V (ml)}
$$
Here,
	$w$ = amount of $H_2C_2O_4.2H_2O$ in gram
	$E$ = equivalent weight of $H_2C_2O_4.2H_2O$
	$V$ = volume of the solution in ml

for this experiment, normality is $0.1N$, $E$ is $63$ and $V$ is $100$. From this we can calculate $w$ and make the desired solution of oxalic acid.

**What is used to acidify the solution of oxalic acid?**
$10\ ml\ 1\ M$ sulfuric acid

**Why we need to warm the solution of oxalic acid after putting sulfuric acid?**
To make the reaction faster

**What is the color change at end point?**
After putting 1-2 drops of potassium permanganate in colorless acidified solution of oxalic acid, it becomes pink. At this point we need to wait until the pink color fades to colorless again. at the end point, a faint pink color will appear which will persists at least 30 seconds. 



# Practical 3

## Standardization of approximately 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate ($Na_2S_2O_3$) solution iodometrically against a standard solution of potassium dichromate (0.1 N) ($K_2Cr_2O_7$)


### Principle

**Iodometry:** Iodometry is a chemical analysis technique that determines the concentration of an oxidizing agent in a solution with the help of iodine liberated in chemical reaction

**Iodometric Titration:** Titration that deals with iodine liberated in chemical reaction is called iodometry or iodometric titration

**Iodimetry:** Iodimetry is a chemical technique that determines the amount of a reducing agent in substance using iodine

**Iodimetric Titration:** Titration involving pure iodine is called iodimetry or iodimetric titration

**Reactions of this experiment:**
$$
6KI + 14HCl + K_2Cr_2O_7 = 2CrCl_3 + 3I_2 + 8KCl + 7H_2O
$$
$$
(6I^- + 14H^+ + Cr_2O_7^{2-} = 2Cr^{3+} + 3I_2 + 7H_2O)
$$
$$
2Na_2S_2O_3 + I_2 = Na_2S_4O_6 + 2NaI
$$
$$
(2S_2O_3^{2-} + I_2 = S_4O_6^{2-} + 2I^-)
$$
1 mole of $K_2Cr_2O_7 \equiv$  3 moles of $I_2 \equiv$ 6 moles of $Na_2S_2O_3$

**What are the oxidizing and reducing agent in the reactions?**
In the first reaction, $K_2Cr_2O_7$ is an oxidizing agent and $I^-$ is a reducing agent. Again, in the second reaction, $I_2$ is an oxidizing agent and $S_2O_3^{2-}$ is a reducing agent.

**What is used as the indicator?**
Starch is used as the indicator as it has a significant characteristic blue color on iodine. This indicator is added at the second step of reaction.
$$
Starch + I_2 = Starch-Iodine\ comlex\ (blue\ color)
$$
$$
Starch-Iodine + 2S_2O_3^{2-} = Starch + 2I^- + S_4O_6^{2-}
$$


**What is the color at the end point?**
After adding starch, blue color appears in the solution, this color will disappear at the end point when all the iodine has been reduced to iodide ion. It will go from greenish blue to light green.


### Experimental Procedure

**How to prepare 100 ml 0.1 N potassium dichromate?**
The molecular weight of potassium dichromate is $294$ an equivalent weight is $\frac {294} 6 = 49$ 
After putting all the values in,
$$
normality = \frac {w \times 1000}{E \times V(ml)}
$$
where,
	$E$ = equivalent weight of potassium dichromate (49)
	$V$ = volume of the solution in ml (100)
	$normality$ = normality (0.1)

We can solve for $w$ and we will be able to create the solution of taking $w$ gram potassium dichromate and create a solution of 100 ml with it.


# Practical 4

## Determination of heat of solution of a supplied sample by calorimetric method

### Introduction & Principle

**Heat of solution:** Heat of solution is defined as amount of heat or enthalpy released or absorbed when one mole of a solute is dissolved in a sufficient amount of solvent. Here sufficient amount of solvent means the amount of solvent which is required for the solute to release the maximum amount of heat
$$
Solute + Solvent \rightarrow Solution + \Delta H\ (heat\ of\ solution)
$$

**Integral heat of solution:** Integral heat of solution is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a solute is dissolved in any amount of solvent.

**Calorimetry:** Calorimetry is the science of measuring the amount of heat transferred to or from a substance.

**Exothermic process:** The process which releases heat to the surroundings is called an exothermic process

**Endothermic process:** The process which absorbs heat from the surrounding is called an endothermic process

**Specific heat capacity:** Specific heat capacity is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one unit of substance by one degree

**Lattice energy:** Lattice energy is the energy released when one mole of an ionic solids form from its constituent ions in the gas phase

**Hydration energy:** Hydration energy is the amount of energy released when one mole of gaseous ion is dissolved in water to form an aqueous solution

### Experimental Procedure

**How to calculate heat of solution?**
$$
\Delta H = \frac {M}{1000W} (m_1s_1 + m_2s_2)(t_2 - t_1)
$$
here,
	$\Delta H$ = heat of solution
	$M$ = Molecular weight of the solute ($KCl$, $74.5$)
	W = weight of the solute
	$m_1$ = mass of calorimeter
	$m_2$ = mass of solution (without calorimeter)
	$s_1$ = specific heat of calorimeter ($0.76\ JK^{-1}g^{-1}$)
	$s_2$ = specific heat of solution = ($4.2\ JK^{-1}g^{-1}$)
	$t_1$ = initial temperature
	$t_2$ = final temperature



# Miscellaneous

**Which is safer 1. Water to acid or 2. acid to water**
Acid to water is safer as acid is hydrophobic. pouring water in acid will cause all acid molecules to rush toward the water which may result in something bad.

**Safety:** Freedom from unacceptable risk

**Hazard:** A situation that may give rise to personal or environmental injury

**Danger:** A state or condition in which personal injury is reasonably foreseeable

**Risk**: Combination of probability of injury and degree of injury

**Accident:** Unplanned or undesired event that may cause to death, illness, injury, damage or loos of life, wealth and environment or their combination

**Titration:** Titration is a concentration determining analytical method of a solution. It can be defined as the method by which the concentration of a test solution (analyte) is determined by reacting it with a standard solution (titrant).

**Equivalence point:** The equivalence point in a titration is a theoretical point reached when the amount of added titrant is chemically equivalent to the amount of analyte in the sample

**End point:** Estimated equivalent point which is found experimentally is called end point.

**Indicators:** Indicator are the weak organic acids and bases which indicate the end point of a titration with the change of a physical properties (especially color) being present in the analyte.

**Primary standards substance**: A primary standard substance is an ultra-pure compound that servers as the reference material for a titration or for another type of quantitative analysis.

- char - 1 byte
- short int - 2 bytes
- int - 4 bytes
- long int - 8 bytes
- float - 4 bytes

**What is a variable?**
A variable is named container in memory which stores data

**What are the naming convention of a variable?**
- first character should be a letter or an underscore
- Subsequent character should be letters, digits or underscores
- Special characters or space is not allowed

**Types of operators**
- Arithmetic operators -> + - * /
- Relational operators -> > >= < <= == !=
- Logical operators -> && || !
- Assignment operators -> = *= += -= /= %=
- Increment and decrement operators -> ++ --
- Unary operators -> operate on only one operand
- Binary operators -> operate on two operands
- Ternary operators -> operate on three operands

**What is function?**
Function is a block of statements that performs a specific task

**Types of function**
- Library Function: also known as pre-define/ built-in function
- User Defined Function

**Local variable and global variable**

|             | Local Variable                                              | Global Variable                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Declaration | Inside a function or block of code                          | Outside of any function or code-block |
| Scope       | Within that function or block of code                       | Throughout the program                |
| Access      | only by the statements inside the function or block of code | Any statement in the entire program   |

**Recursive function**
A function that calls itself is called a recursive function

**Arguments and Parameters**

| Arguments                                                       | Parameters                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The values passed within a function when the function is called | Local variables used to receive the arguments, declared after the function name and inside 1st parentheses during function definition |
| Also called actual arguments                                    | Also called formal parameters                                                                                                         |

**What is a pointer?**
Pointer is a variable that stores a memory address of another object typically another variable.

**How to pass a string or an array as an argument in a function**
We can pass the base address of the array or string.

**What is a structure?**
Structure is a collection of variables referenced under one name

**What is union?**
Union is a memory location shared by different types of variables

**What is enumeration?**
Enumeration is a lit of named integer constants

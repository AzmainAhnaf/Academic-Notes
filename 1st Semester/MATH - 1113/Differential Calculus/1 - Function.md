**What is a function?**
A function is a relation between dependent and independent variables.

Example:
$$
(i)\ f(x)\ =\ x^2\ +\ 2
$$
$$
(ii)\ y\ =\ 2x\ +\ 1
$$

# Odd and Even Functions

1. Odd Function: A function *f*(x) is said to be odd if it changes sign with the change of sign of the variable x that is if *f*(-x) = -*f*(x).

$$
f(x)\ =\ x^3
$$

2. Even Function: A function *f*(x) is said to be even if it does not change sign with the change of sign of the variable x that is if *f*(-x) = *f*(x)

$$
f(x)\ =\ x^2
$$
# Monotone Function

Let, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub> be any two points such that x<sub>1</sub> < x<sub>2</sub> in the interval of definition of a function *f*(x), then 
*f*(x) is said to be monotonically increasing if *f*(x<sub>1</sub>) < *f*(x<sub>2</sub>) and monotonically decreasing if *f*(x<sub>1</sub>) > *f*(x<sub>2</sub>)

Ideal current source have internal resistance. Internal resistance and current source are connected in parallel. Value of internal resistance is infinite.

A voltage source in series with a resistor can be transformed to a current source in parallel with a resistor and a current source in parallel with a resistor can be transformed to a voltage source in series with a resistor

The two circuits in above figure are equivalent when they have the same voltage-current relation at terminals a-b

When terminals a-b of circuit-1 are short circuited, then the short-circuit current flowing from $a$ to $b$ is $i_{sc} = \frac{v_s}R$.

When terminals a-b of circuit-2 are short-circuited, then the short-circuit current flowing from $a$ to $b$ is $i_{sc} = i_s$.

Two circuits in above figure are equivalent when short circuit current are same. So relation of source transformation is
$$
i_s = \frac {v_s}{R}
$$

**Source transformation is the process of replacing a voltage source $v_s$ in series with a resistor $R$ by a current source $i_s$ is in parallel with a resistor $R$, or vice versa**
- Source transformation is not possible when $R = 0$
- Arrow of the current source is directed toward the positive terminal of the voltage source (as per following figure)

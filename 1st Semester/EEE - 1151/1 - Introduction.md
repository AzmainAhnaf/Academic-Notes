**An electric circuit is an interconnection of electrical elements**

Electric current is the time rate of change of charge, measure in amperes ($A$)

Mathematically, the relationship between current $i$, charge $q$, and time $t$ is
$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt}
$$

A direct current (dc) is a current that remains constant with time.

An alternating current (ac) is a current that varies with time

**Voltage:** Voltage (or potential difference) is the energy required to move a unit charge through an element

Unit of voltage is volt($V$)

Point a is at $a$ potential of $v_{ab}$ volts higher than point $b$

$$
v_{ab} = -v_{ba}
$$


# Circuit Elements

Circuit elements are two types

- Passive element
- Active element

**An active element is capable of generating energy**
- Generator

**A [[12 - Impedance|passive element]] can not generate energy**
- Resistor
- Inductor
- Capacitor

# Source

Sources are two types

1. Independent source
2. Dependent source


## Independent Source

**An ideal independent source is an active element that provides a specified voltage or current that is completely independent of other circuit elements**

## Dependent Source

An ideal dependent (or controlled) source is an active element in which the source quantity is controlled by another voltage or current

Dependent sources are four types

1. Voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS)
2. Current-controlled voltage source (CCVS)
3. Voltage-controlled current source (VCCS)
4. Current-controlled current source (CCCS)

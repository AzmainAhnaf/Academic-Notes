# Photochemical Reactions and Photochemistry

Ordinary reaction occur by absorption of heat energy from outside. The reacting molecules are energized and molecular collisions become effective. These bring about the reaction. **The reactions which are caused by heat and in absence of light are called thermal or dark reactions**

On the other hand, some reactions proceed by absorption of light radiations. These belong to the visible and ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (200 nm to 800 nm). The reactant molecules absorbs photons of light and get excited. These excited molecules then proceed the reactions

**A reaction which takes place by absorption of the visible and/or ultraviolet radiations is called a photochemical reaction**

**The branch of chemistry which deals with the study of photochemical reactions is called photochemistry**

## Demonstration of a Photochemical Reaction

A mixture of hydrogen and chlorine remains unchanged with lapse of time. but when exposed to light, the reaction occurs with a loud explosion.
$$
H_2 + Cl_2 \xrightarrow[]{dark} \text{No Reaction}
$$
$$
H_2 + Cl_2 \xrightarrow[]{light} 2HCl
$$

A bottle is filled with equimolar amounts of hydrogen and chlorine. It is tightly stoppered with a handball. When the lamp is turned on, a beam of light falls on the mixture through the bottom of the bottle. The reactions occurs with an explosion. The ball is expelled with high velocity so that it strikes the opposite wall of the lecture theatre.

# Laws of Photochemistry

There are two fundamental laws governing photochemical reactions and two more laws about light absorption:
- The Grothus-Draper Law
- The Stark-Einstein Law of Photochemical Equivalence
- Lambert's Law
- Beer's Law


## Grothus-Draper Law

**Grothus-Draper Law states that only the light which is absorbed by a substance can bring about a photochemical reaction.**

When light falls on a cell containing a reaction mixture, some light is absorbed and the remaining light is transmitted. Obviously, it is the absorbed component of light that is capable of producing the reaction. The transmitted light is ineffective chemically.

However, it does not mean that the absorption of radiation must necessarily be followed by a chemical reaction. When the conditions are not favorable for the molecules to react, the light energy remains unused. It may be re-emitted as heat or light. The law is pure qualitative in nature and gives no idea of the relation between the absorbed radiation and the molecules undergoing change.



## Stark-Einstein Law of Photochemical Equivalence

Stark and Einstein studied the quantitative aspect of photochemical reactions by application of Quantum theory of light. They noted that each molecule taking part in the reaction absorbs only a single quantum or photon of light. The molecule that gains one photo-equivalent energy is activated and enters into reaction.

**Stark-Einstein Law of Photochemical Equivalence states that in a photochemical reaction, each molecule of the reacting substance absorbs a single photon of radiation causing the reaction and is activated to form the products**

$$
A + hv \rightarrow A^*
$$
$$
A^* \rightarrow B
$$
$$
\text{overall, } A + hv \rightarrow B
$$
In practice, it refers to molar quantities rather than molecular quantities, that is, one mole of $A$ absorbs one mole of photons or one Einstein of energy, $E$.

We know that, $Energy = nhf = nh \frac c \lambda$
For, one Einstein energy, $n$ = $6.023 \times 10^{23}$

Using these we get,
$$
E = \frac {6.023 \times 10^{23} \times 6.3 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{\lambda}\ Jmol^{-1}
$$
In SI,
$$
E = \frac {0.1198}{\lambda}\ Jmol^{-1}
$$
In CGS format,
$$
E = \frac{1.198 \times 10^{16}}{\lambda (\text{in angstrom})}\ erg\ mol^{-1}
$$
In calorie,
$$
1 cal = 4.184 \times 10^7 ergs
$$
$$
E = \frac {2.859 \times 10^5}{\lambda \text{ (in angstrom)}}\ Kcal\ mol^{-1}
$$


## Lambert's Law

**Lambert's Law states that when a beam of light is allowed to pass through a transparent medium, the rate of decrease of intensity with the thickness of medium is directly proportional to the intensity of light.**

$$
- \frac {dI}I \propto dl
$$
$$
-\frac {dI}I =\propto kdl\ ...\ (i)
$$
Here,
	$I$ = intensity of the light
	$l$ = thickness of medium
	$k$ = proportional factors

Integrating equation $(i)$
$$
-\int_{I_o}^I \frac{dI}I = \int_0^lkdl
$$
$$
or,\ -ln \frac{I}{I_o} = kl
$$
$$
or,\ ln \frac I{I_o} = -kl
$$
$$
or,\ I = I_oe^{-kl}
$$

## Beer's Law

**Beer's Law states that the intensity of a beam of monochromatic light decreases exponentially with the increase in concentration of the absorbing substances arithmetically**
$$
I = I_oe^{-kc}
$$
Here, $c$ = concentration
From Lambert's Law,
$$
ln \frac {I_o}I = kl\ ...(i)
$$
From Beer's Law,
$$
ln \frac {I_o}I = kc\ ...(ii)
$$
Combining equation $(i)$ and $(ii)$. we get,
$$
cl = \frac 1k ln \frac {I_o}I \times \frac 1k ln \frac {I_o}I\ ...(iii)
$$
We can write,
$$
\frac 1 \epsilon = \frac 1 {k^2} ln \frac {I_o}I
$$
Where,
	$\epsilon$ = Molar extinction coefficient

Plotting value of $\epsilon$ in equation $(iii)$ we get the equation for Beer-Lambert's Law
$$
ln \frac {I_o}{I} = \epsilon cl
$$

### Limitation
1. Can not work in non-monochromatic light
2. Can not work if temperature is changed
3. Works perfectly only for diluted solution





# Quantum Yield (or Quantum Efficiency)

**The number of molecules reacted or formed per photon of light absorbed is termed Quantum yield.** It is denoted by $\phi$ so that,
$$
\phi = \frac{\text{No. of molecules reacted or formed}}{\text{No. of photons absorbed}}
$$

- For a reaction that obeys strictly the Einstein law, one molecule decomposes per  photon, the quantum yield, $\phi = 1$
- When two or more molecules are decomposed per photon, $\phi > 1$, then the reaction has a high quantum yield
- If the number of molecules decomposed is less than one per photo, the reaction has a low quantum yield ($\phi < 1$)


Cause of high quantum yield:
- Free radical, which initiates chain reaction
- Formation of intermediate products which will act as a catalyst
- For exothermic reaction, activate the other molecule without absorbing photon
- Activated molecules collides with each other of non-activated molecules and activate the other reacting molecules


### Decomposition of $HI$:
$$
HI \xrightarrow[]{hv} H^* + I^* \text{ (primary reaction)}
$$
$$
H^* + HI \rightarrow H_2 + I^* \text{ (secondary reaction)}
$$
$$
I^* + I^* = I_2
$$
Overall,
$$
2HI + hv \rightarrow H_2 + I_2
$$
$$
\phi = \frac 21 = 2
$$

Causes of low quantum yield:
- Excited molecules deactivated before forming products
- Excited molecules lose their energy by collision
- Receive insufficient energy
- Primary reaction may be reversed
- Recombination of dissociated fragments


## Reaction process of photochemical

### Primary Reaction

Molecule $A$, absorbs photon and become excited molecule $A^*$
$$
A \xrightarrow[]{hv} A^*
$$

### Secondary Reaction

Excited molecule react further to give the produce of higher quantum yield
$$
A^* \rightarrow B
$$



# Photosensitized Reactions

In many photochemical reactions, the reactant molecule does not absorb the radiation required for the reaction. Hence the reaction is not possible. In such cases the reaction may still occur if a foreign species such as mercury vapor is present. The mercury atom absorbs the incident radiation and subsequently transfer its energy to the reactant molecule which is then activated. Thus the reaction occurs. **A species which can both absorb and transfer radiant energy for activation of the reactant molecule, is called a photosensitizer.** The reaction caused by photosensitizer is called a photosensitized reaction.

The role of mercury vapor is that of a go-between. The mercury atom absorbs the incident radiation and is excited. The excited atom collides with a reactant molecule $A$ and transfer to it the excitation energy. This energy is enough to activate the molecule $A$. The mercury atom returns to the original un-activated state
$$
Hg + hv \rightarrow Hg^*
$$
$$
Hg^* + A \rightarrow A^* + Hg
$$

Examples:
### Reactions between $H_2$ and $O_2$

This reaction is photosensitized by mercury vapor. The produce is hydrogen peroxide, $H_2O_2$
$$
Hg + hv \rightarrow Hg^* \text{ (Primary absorption)}
$$
$$
Hg^* + H_2 \rightarrow 2H + Hg
$$
$$
H + O_2 \rightarrow HO_2
$$
$$
HO_2 + HO_2 \rightarrow H_2O_2 + O_2
$$



### Reaction between $H_2$ and $CO$

Mercury vapor is used as photosensitizer. The produce is formaldehyde, $HCHO$
$$
Hg + hv \rightarrow Hg^*
$$
$$
Hg^* + H_2 \rightarrow 2H^* + Hg
$$
$$
H + CO \rightarrow HCO
$$
$$
HCO + H_2 \rightarrow HCHO + H
$$
$$
2HCO \rightarrow HCHO + CO
$$



# Photophysical Processes

If the absorbed radiation is not used to cause a chemical change, it is re-emitted as light of longer wavelength. The three such photo-physical processes which can occur are
- Fluorescence
- Phosphorescence
- Chemiluminescence


## Fluorescence

Certain molecules (or atoms) when exposed to light radiation of short wavelength (high frequency), emit light of longer wavelength. The process is called fluorescence and substance that exhibits fluorescence is called florescent substance. Fluorescence stops as soon as the incident radiation is cut off

Examples
- A solution of quinine sulphate on exposure to visible light, exhibits blue fluorescence
- A solution of chlorophyll in ether shows blood red fluorescence

Explanation: When a molecule absorbs high energy radiation, it is excited to higher energy states. Then it emits excess energy through several transitions to the ground state. Thus the excited molecule emits light of longer wavelength. The color of fluorescence depends on the wavelength of light emitted.

![[Pasted image 20250219022900.png]]

1. A photon of energy is absorbed by the fluorophore molecule
2. Some of the energy is dissipated as heat or other processes
3. As the electrons in the fluorophore return to ground state, a photon of lower energy and longer wavelength is emitted.



## Phosphorescence

**When a substance absorbs radiation of high frequency and emits light even after the incident radiation is cut off, the process is called phosphorescence.** The substances which shows phosphorescence is called phosphorescent substance.

Phosphorescence is mainly caused by ultraviolet and visible light. It is generally shown by solids.

Examples:
- Sulphates of calcium, barium and strontium exhibit phosphorescence
- Fluorescein in boric acid shows phosphorescence in the blue region at $570 nm$ wavelength.

Explanation:
$$
A + hv \rightarrow A^* \rightarrow \text{slow} \rightarrow hv
$$

As in fluorescence, a molecule absorbs light radiation and gets excited. While returning to the ground state, it emits light energy of longer wavelength. In doing so the excited molecule passes from one series of electronic states to another and gets trapped. This shows the emission of light which persists even after the removal of light source. Thus phosphorescence could be designated as delayed fluorescence

![[Pasted image 20250219034853.png]]



## Chemiluminescence

Some chemical reactions are accompanied by the emission of visible light at ordinary temperature. **The emission of light as a result of chemical action is called chemiluminescence.** The reaction is referred to as a chemiluminescent reaction. Such a reaction is the reverse of a photochemical reaction which proceeds by absorption of light. The light emitted in a chemiluminescent reaction is called 'cold light' because it is produced at ordinary temperature

Examples:
- The glow of fireflies due to the aerial oxidation of luciferin (a protein) in the presence of enzyme luciferase
- The oxidation of 5-aminophtalic cyclic hydrazide (luminol) by hydrogen peroxide in alkaline solution, producing bright green light.

Explanation: In a chemiluminescent reaction, the energy released in the reaction makes the product  molecule electronically excited. The excited molecule then gives up its excess energy as visible light while reverting to ground state

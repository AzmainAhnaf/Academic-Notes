# Types of Conductors of Electricity

**Conductors:** The substances through which electricity passes are known as the conductors of electricity or electrical conductors

**Insulators:** The substances through which electricity does not pass are known as electrical insulators

Based on the mode passage of electricity through a conductor, it can be divided into two different types
1. Electronic Conductors
2. Electrolytic Conductors

**Electronic Conductors:** Electronic conductor is a type of conductor, that allows electricity to flow through it due to the movement of free electrons within its structure. They are also known as metallic conductors. No chemical reaction or mass transfer takes place in this process.

**Electrolytic Conductors:** Electrolytic conductor is a type of conductor, that allows electricity to flow through it due to the movement of ions within its structure. Chemical reaction and mass transfer takes place in this process

**Electrolytes:** The substances through which (either in molten state or aqueous solution) electricity passes by the transfer of ions are called electrolytes. Such as ionic compounds ($NaCl$, $NaOH$, $HCl$).

**Non-electrolytes:** The substances through which (either in molten state or in aqueous solution) electricity does not pass are called non-electrolytes. Such as covalent compounds (sugar, alcohol, glucose).



# Electrolysis

**The process in which electricity passes through the molten electrolyte or its aqueous solution and at the same time chemical reaction takes place is called electrolysis.**

Here direct current is used to cause a non-spontaneous chemical reaction due to it chemical decomposition of electrolytes takes place or it is the flow of electrons across the boundary followed by a chemical reaction that is, redox reaction. It occurs in electrolytic cell and it takes place at electrodes

The apparatus in which electrolysis is carried out is known as electrolytic cell.

**Anode:** The electrode at which oxidation reaction takes places is called anode

**Cathode:** The electrode at which reduction reaction takes place is called cathode.

For example, when electricity passes through the molten state of $NaCl$, it is found that, $Cl$ gas is produced at the anode (the positive electrode) and $Na$ metal is produced at the cathode (the negative electrode).


# Electrolytic Cell and Electrochemical Cell

**Electrolytic Cell:** The cell in which chemical reaction is carried out by the application of electrical energy is called electrolytic cell

**Electrochemical Cell:** The cell in which electrical energy (electricity) is produced from chemical reaction (chemical energy) is called electrochemical cell

![[Pasted image 20250215232803.png]]


# Mechanism of Electrolytic Conductance

The anode is connected to the positive terminal of the battery and cathode is connected to the negative terminal of the battery in electrolytic cell. In this case, anode is positive electrode and cathode is negative electrode.

Reduction reaction takes place at cathode. As cathode is the negative electrode, positive ions are attracted to it that causes reactions like following:
$$
M^{n+} + n\ e^- \rightarrow M
$$
$$
2H^+ (aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2
$$
From solution of the salts of alkali and alkaline earth metals as well as the solution of acids the substance set free at the cathode is hydrogen gas.

Oxidation takes places at the positive electrode anode. If the anode is made of a metal that can react (like $Zn$, $Cu$, $Fe$, $Ni$, etc.), the metal atoms lose electrons (oxidation) as a result, the metal dissolves into the solution. If the anode is made of an inert metal (like platinum, $Pt$) or a non-reactive material, the metal doesn't react or dissolve instead, something from the solution reacts. For example: If the solution contain nitrates, sulfates, or phosphates, oxygen gas ($O_2$) is released at the anode of if the solution contains halides (like chloride, bromide, iodide, but not fluoride), the corresponding halogen gas is released.
$$
2X^- \rightarrow X_2 + 2e^-
$$



# Conductivity of Electrolytic Solution

The power of electrolytes to conduct electric currents is termed as conductivity or conductance. Like metallic conductors, electrolytes also obey Ohm's law. According to this law, when $I$ ampere current is passed through a electrolytic conductor/solution then,
$$
I = \frac VR
$$
Where,
	$V$ = electromotive force or potential difference between the two electrodes.
	$R$ = resistance of the conductor measure in Ohms ($\ohm$)

The resistance $R$ of a conductor is directly proportional to its length $l$, and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area $A$,. That is
$$
R \propto \frac lA
$$
$$
R = \rho \frac lA
$$
Where,
	$\rho$ = the proportionality constant and it is called resistivity or specific resistance. Its value depends on the material of the conductor

From above equation, we can write
$$
\rho = \frac{R \times A}{l}
$$
When, $l$ = 1 cm, $A$ = 1 cm<sup>2</sup>, then
$$
\rho = R
$$
So we can define the specific resistance as the resistance of conductor with one cm length and one cm<sup>2</sup> of cross sectional area.

The unit of specific resistance can be determine from the above equation
$$
\rho = \frac {R \times A}l
$$
$$
\frac{\ohm \times cm^2}{cm}
$$
$$
unit = \ohm-cm
$$

## Conductance

**The reciprocal term of resistance is called conductance.** It is denoted by $L$. So conductance is related to the resistance as follows.
$$
L = \frac1R
$$
$$
L = \frac{A}{\rho \times l}
$$
Unit: The unit of the conductance is $\ohm ^{-1}$ or $\mho$ or $S$ (Siemens)


## Specific Conductance

**The reciprocal term of the specific resistance or resistivity is called specific conductance or conductivity**. It is denoted by $\kappa$ (kappa). That is,
$$
\kappa = \frac 1\rho
$$
$$
\kappa = \frac {l}{R \times A}
$$
Unit: The unit of specific conductance can be determine from the above equation and it is $S\ cm ^{-1}$ 

Specific conductance increases with ionic concentration and speed of the ions concerned


## Equivalent Conductance

The specific conductance of a solution depends upon the concentration of the solution. There in order to compare the conductivity of different electrolytes, it is necessary to keep the concentration of electrolyte solution constant. The most convenient way to express the constant concentration is the normality. Normality of a solution is defined as the amount of solute in gram equivalent of solute dissolved per liter of solution. Equivalent conductance is defined as the conductance of an electrolyte obtained by dissolving one gram-equivalent of it in $V_{cc}$ of water. It is denoted by $\Lambda$. It is equal to the product of the specific conductance, $\kappa$ and the volume $V$ in ml containing one gram-equivalent of the electrolyte. Thus,
$$
\Lambda = \kappa \times V
$$
![[Pasted image 20250216004412.png]]

In general, if an electrolyte solution contains N gram-equivalents in 1000 cc of the solution, the volume of the solution containing 1 gram-equivalent will be 1000/N cc Thus,
$$
\Lambda = \frac {\kappa \times 1000}{N}
$$

**Unit of Equivalent Conductance:** The unit of equivalent conductance may be deduced as follows
$$
\Lambda = \kappa \times V
$$
$$
\Lambda = \frac 1R \times \frac lA \times V
$$
$$
\Lambda = \frac 1{ohm} \times \frac{cm}{cm^2} \times \frac {cm^3}{eqvt}
$$
$$
\Lambda = ohm^{-1}cm^2eqvt^{-1}
$$



## Molar Conductance

**Molar conductance of an electrolyte can be defined as the conductance of a volume of solution containing one mole of the solute**. It is denoted by $\mu$

It is obtained by multiplying the specific conductance $\kappa$, by the volume of solution in $cc$ containing one mole of the electrolyte. Thus,
$$
\mu = \kappa \times V_{cc}
$$
Where, $V$ is the volume of the solution in $cc$ containing one mole of the electrolyte
$$
\mu = \kappa \times \frac{1000}{C_M}
$$
Here, $C_M$ is the concentration of the solution in molarity.

**Unites of Molar Conductance:** The unit of molar conductance of an electrolyte solution may be deduced as follows
$$
\mu = \kappa \times V
$$
$$
\mu = \frac 1R \times \frac lA \times V
$$
$$
\mu = \frac {1}{ohm} \times \frac {cm}{cm^2} \times \frac {cm^3}{mole}
$$
$$
\mu = ohm^{-1}cm^2mole^{-1}
$$

![[Pasted image 20250216112043.png]]


## Cell Constant

The distance between the two electrodes and their areas of cross sections of space between the two electrodes are fixed. So, $\frac lA$ is fixed for a particular cell. This constant is called cell constant and is designates as $K$

We know that,
$$
R = \rho \times \frac lA
$$
$$
R = \rho \times K
$$
Where,
	cell constant, $K = \frac lA$ 

Furthermore,
$$
\frac 1\rho = \frac 1R \times K
$$
$$
\kappa = \frac 1R \times K
$$

The cell constant has the unit of $\frac{cm}{cm^2}$ = $cm^{-1}$. in SI unit $m^{-1}$ is taken as the unit of cell constant.

## Factors affecting the specific conductance and equivalent conductance


### Effect of Dilution on Specific Conductance and Equivalent Conductance


Specific Conductance measures how well a small volume of solution (1 cc) can conduct electricity

For Specific Conductance, the factors affecting specific conductance is ionic concentration and speed of the ions concerned. When we dilute a solution the ionic concentration decreases. Or the number of ions in that small volume decreases, as a result, specific conductance decreases with dilution of solution.

Equivalent Conductance measures how well a solution can conduct electricity when you have a fixed amount of the substance (1 gram-equivalent) in the solution \[1 mole for molar conductance]

We know that, $\Lambda = \kappa \times V$

The equivalent conductance shows an increase if the solution is diluted as $V$, volume containing one gram-equivalent of solute increases with dilution, although $\kappa$ or specific conductance decreases, the amount increased by $V$ is much more than that of specific conductance. That's why equivalent conductance or molar conductance increases with dilution of solution.

In case of strong electrolyte, it is completely ionized at all concentrations (or dilutions). So upon dilution, the number of current carrying species (ions) per cc of solution decreases, for this reason the specific conductance decreases.
$$
NaCl \longrightarrow Na^+ + Cl^-
$$
$$
KOH \longrightarrow K^+ + OH^-
$$

In case of weak electrolyte, it is not completely ionized rather partially ionized. Upon dilution, the more of the electrolyte is ionized. As a result, total number of ions increases but the number of current carrying species (ions) per cc of solution still decreases, for this reason the specific conductance decreases



# Factors Affecting the Electrolytic Conductance


## Concentration of Ions in the Solution

The sole reason for the conductivity of electrolytes is the ions present in them. The conductivity of electrolytes increases with an increase in the concentration of ions as there will be more charge carriers if the concentration of ions is more and hence the conductivity of electrolytes will be high.



## Type of Electrolyte or Nature of Electrolyte

Electrolytic conduction is significantly affected by the nature of electrolytes. The degree of dissociation of electrolytes determines the concentration of ions in the solution and hence the conductivity of electrolytes. Substances such as $CH_3COOH$, with a small degree of dissociation, will have less number of ions in the solution and hence their conductivity will also be low, and these are called weak electrolytes. Strong electrolytes such as $KNO_3$ have a high degree of dissociation and hence their solutions have a high concentration of ions, so they are good electrolytic conductance



## Temperature

The temperature is a significant factor influencing the dissolution of electrolytes in a solvent. The degree of electrolyte dissolution in a solution is affected by temperature. It has been observed that elevated temperatures enhance the solubility of electrolytes, consequently increasing the concentration of ions and resulting in elevated electrolytic conduction



## Size of Ions

The conductance of an electrolyte is also contingent upon the size of the ion that is produced through the dissociation of the electrolyte. It can be reasonably deduced that the large the size on ion, the lower the conductance. Therefore, it can be stated that the conductance of an ion is inversely proportional to the size of the ion. This is due to the fact that larger ion exhibit reduced mobility towards the electrode in comparison to smaller ions.



## Type of Solvent or Polarity of Solvent

Polarity is also a significant factor influencing the electrolytic conductance of an electrolyte. The higher the polarity of the solvent, the greater the electrolytic conductivity. This is due to the fact that a highly polar solvent facilitates greater solubility of the electrolyte in the solution, resulting in an increased concentration of ions or carries. Consequently, the electrolytic conductivity rises.




# Arrhenius Theory of Ionization or Dissociation


The word electrolyte is used to describe ionic solutes that can conduct electricity.

The main points of the theory are:

1. An electrolyte, when dissolved in water, breaks up into two types of charge particles, one carrying a positive charge and the other a negative charge. These charge particles are called ions. Positively charged ions are termed as cations and the negatively charge as anions. In this modern form, theory assumes that solid electrolytes are composed of ions which are held together by electrostatic forces of attraction. When an electrolyte is dissolved in a solvent, these forces are weakened and the electrolyte undergoes dissociation into ions. The ions are solvated in the solution.
$$
AB \longrightarrow A^+ + B^-
$$
$$
NaCl \longrightarrow Na^+ + Cl^-
$$
$$
K_2SO_4 \longrightarrow 2K^+ + SO_4^{2-}
$$

2. **The process of splitting of the molecules into ions of an electrolyte is called ionization**. The fraction of the total number of molecules present in the solution as ions is known as degree of ionization or degree of dissociation. It is denoted by
$$
\alpha = \frac{number\ of\ molecules\ dissociated\ into\ ions}{total\ number\ of\ molecules}
$$

3. It have been observed that all electrolytes do not ionize to the same extent. Some are almost completely ionized while other are feebly ionized. The degree of ionization depends on a number of factors

4. Ions present in solution constantly reunite to form neutral molecules and thus there is a state of dynamic equilibrium between the ionized ions and the non-ionized molecules, i.e.,

$$
AB \rightleftharpoons A^+ + b^-
$$
	Applying the law of mass action to the above equilibrium,
$$
K = \frac{[A^+][B^-]}{[AB]}
$$
	Here, $K$ is known as ionization constant. The electrolytes having high value of $K$ are termed as strong electrolytes and those having low value of $K$ as weak electrolytes

5. When an electric current is passed through the electrolytic solution, the positive ions (cations) move towards the cathode and the negative ions (anions) move towards anode and get discharged, i.e., electrolysis occurs. The ions are discharges always in equivalent amounts, no matter what theirs speeds are.

6. The electrolytic solutions are neutral in nature as total charge on one set of ions is always equal to the total charge on the other set of ions. However, it is not necessary that number of two sets ions must be equal always

| $AB \rightleftharpoons A^+ + B^-$       | $NaCl \rightleftharpoons Na^+ + Cl^-$           | Both ions are equal               |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| $AB_2 \rightleftharpoons A^{2+} + 2B^-$ | $BaCl_2 \rightleftharpoons Ba^{2+} + 2Cl^-$     | Anions are double that of cations |
| $A_2B \rightleftharpoons 2A^+ + B^{2-}$ | $Na_2SO_4 \rightleftharpoons 2Na^+ + SO_4^{2-}$ | Cations are double that of anions |

7. The properties of electrolytes in solution are the properties of ions present in the solution. For example, acidic solution always contains $H^+$ ions while basic solution always contains $HO^-$ ions and the characteristics of the solutions are those of $H^+$ and $HO^-$ ions respectively.

8. The ions act like molecules towards depressing the freezing point, elevating the boiling point, lowering of vapor pressure and establishing the osmotic pressure

9. The conductivity of the electrolytic solution depends on the nature and number of ions as the current is carried through solution by the movement of ions


To summarize the points up,

1->Electrolytes dissociate into ions
2&3->Ionization and degree of dissociation
4->Dynamic equilibrium
5->Neutrality of electrolytic solutions
6->Electrolyte may differ in molecule but will not in charge
7&8->Ions acts like molecules
9->Conductivity of solutions



# Transport Number

During electrolysis the current is carried by the anions and the cations. The fraction of the total current carried by the cation or anion is termed as its transport number or Hittorf's number. Transport number of an ion is directly related to its speed of migration through the electrolyte solution. if $v_+$ represents the speed of migration of cation and $v_-$ is that of the anion,

The transport number of cation = $\frac {v_+}{v_+ + v_-}$
The transport number of anion = $\frac{v_-}{v_+ + v_-}$

the transport number of cation is represented by $t_+$ and that of anion is represented by $t_{-}$. Thus,
$$
t_+ = \frac {v_+}{v_+ + v_-}
$$
$$
t_- = \frac {v_-}{v_+ + v_-}
$$
Furthermore,
$$
\frac {t_+}{t_-} = \frac {v_+}{v_-}
$$
$$
t_+ + t_- = 1
$$
If the ratio of speeds of cation and anion is denoted by $r$, then we can write
$$
r = \frac {v_+}{v_-} = \frac {t_+}{t_-} = \frac {t_+}{1 - t_+}
$$
$$
and,\ 1 + r = 1 + \frac {t_+}{t_-}
$$
$$
or,\ 1 + r = \frac {t_+ + t_-}{t_-}
$$
$$
or,\ t_- = \frac 1{1 + r}
$$


# Equivalent Conductance at Infinite Dilution

Equivalent conductance at infinite dilution, often denoted as $\lambda _0$, is a fundamental concept in electrochemistry. 

**Equivalent Conductance at infinite dilution is defined as the conductivity of an electrolyte solution when it is infinitely diluted**, meaning the concentration of the electrolyte is extremely low. At infinite dilution, the electrolyte is completely dissociated into its constituent ions. This means that there are no inter-ionic interactions between the ions, as they are far apart from each other.

The solution of strong electrolytes such as $KCl$, $NaCl$, $CaCl_2$, $Na_2SO_4$, $CH_3COONa$, $HCl$, $H_2SO_4$ etc. have very high conductance even at ordinary concentrations. With dilution their equivalent conductance increases almost linearly and ultimately tend to reach a limiting value. **The limiting equivalent conductance of infinitely dilute is called equivalent conductance of infinite dilution.** This is denoted as $\lambda _0$. On further dilution after infinite dilution there would be no change in the equivalent conductance. From the experimental results Kohlrausch suggest an empirical relation between the concentration ($C$) and the equivalent conductance ($\lambda _c$) as follows
$$
\lambda_c = \lambda_0 - b \sqrt{C}
$$
Where, $b$ is a constant

At a very low concentration, $\lambda_c = \lambda_0$

In general it can be said that conductance of an electrolyte depends upon three factors: (a) number of ions present into the solution, (b) charge of the ions and (c) velocity or speed of the ions. That's why the equivalent conductance of strong electrolytes vary linearly with dilution and reaches a limiting value.

![[Pasted image 20250216221902.png]]

For strong electrolyte and equivalent conductance, the product of the number of ion and charge of that ion becomes constant at any concentration. So the equivalent conductance depends upon the velocity of the ion, which is largely influenced by the inter-ionic attraction. The inter-ionic attraction of ions in a solution decreases with increase in dilution. Thus the velocity of ion increases. Consequently the equivalent conductance increases with increase in dilution



# Kohlrausch's Law of Independent Migration of Ions

Also known as Kohlrausch's Law

**It states that the equivalent conductance of an electrolyte at infinite dilution is equal to the sum of the equivalent conductance of the component ions.**

The law may be expressed mathematically as:
$$
\lambda^0 = \lambda^0_c + \lambda^0_a
$$
Where,
	$\lambda^0$ = the equivalent conductance of the electrolyte at infinite dilution
	$\lambda^0_c$ = the equivalent conductance of the component cation at infinite dilution
	$\lambda^0_a$ = the equivalent conductance of the component anion at infinite dilution

For example. the equivalent conductance of $NaCl$ at infinite dilution at $25 \degree C$ is found to be $126.45\ S$. The equivalent conductance of $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$ ions are $50.11\ S$ and $76.34\ S$ respectively. Thus,
$$
\lambda^0_{NaCl} = \lambda^0_{Na^+} + \lambda^0_{Cl^-}
$$
This is in conformity with the Kohlrausch's Law.

While investigating the equivalent conductance at infinite dilution ($\lambda^0$) of a number of electrolytes having a common ion (either cation or anion) Kohlrausch noticed that the different in ($\lambda^0$) values was same irrespective of the nature of the counter ions of the electrolytes

For example, the different in the ($\lambda^0$) values of $K$ and $Na$ salts with common ions are same. That is,
$$
\lambda^0_{KCl} - \lambda^0_{NaCl} = \lambda^0_{KNO_3} - \lambda^0_{NaNO_3} = \lambda^0_{KAc} - \lambda^0_{NaAc} = \lambda^0_{\frac 12 K_2SO_4} - \lambda^0_{\frac 12 Na_2SO_4}
$$

An analysis of the results presented above reveal that the constancy in the different of ($\lambda^0$) values of two salts having a common ion would be possible only, if each ion has a definite contribution to the conductivity of the solution irrespective of the value of the counter ion. That is,
$$
\lambda^0_{KCl} = \lambda^0_{K^+} + \lambda^0_{Cl^-}
$$
$$
\lambda^0_{NaCl} = \lambda^0_{Na^+} + \lambda^0_{Cl^-}
$$
Hence, 
$$
\lambda^0_{KCl} - \lambda^0_{NaCl} = \lambda^0_{K^+} - \lambda^0_{Na^+}
$$
Which is a constant value considering the cations are always $K^+$ and $Na^+$

## Application

- Calculation of equivalent conductance $\lambda^0$ for weak electrolytes
- Calculation of absolute ionic mobilities
- Calculation of the solubility of sparingly soluble salts
- Calculation of the degree of dissociation or conductance ratio
- Calculation of ionic product for water

# Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis

## Faraday's First Law of Electrolytes

**The First Law states that the amount of substance or quantity of chemical reaction at electrode is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed into the cell**

Mathematically,
$$
W \propto q
$$
$$
or,\ W \propto It
$$
$$
W = Zit
$$
$$
W = \frac{Mit}{nF}, \ Z = \frac{M}{nF}
$$
Where,
	$Z$ = Electrochemical equivalence
	M = Molar mass
	F = Amount of charge in one mole of electron = 96500 Coulomb
	n = Number of electrons transfer
	q = amount of charge utilized

**Electrochemical equivalent is the amount of the substance deposited or liberated by one ampere current passing for one second (which is 1 coulomb) or one coulomb of charge**

One gm of equivalent of any substance is liberated by one faraday

$$
Eq.\ Wt = Z \times 96500
$$
$$
\frac{W}{E} = \frac{q}{96500}
$$
$$
W = \frac{Eq}{96500} = \frac{Eit}{96500}
$$
as,
$$
W = a \times l \times d
$$
where,
	$a$ = area of the object to be electroplated
	$l$ = thickness of the layer deposited
	$d$ = density of the metal to be deposited

Hence from here we can predict charge, current, strength ,time, thickness of deposited layer etc.



## Faraday's Second Law of Electrolytes

**The Second Law state that when the same quantity of electricity is passed through different electrolytes, the amounts of the products obtained at the electrodes are directly proportional to their chemical equivalents or equivalents weights**
Mathematically,
$$
\frac{E_{1}}{E_{2}} = \frac{W_{1}}{W_{2}} = \frac{Z_{1}it}{Z_{2}it} = \frac{Z_{1}}{Z_{2}}
$$
Where,
	$E$ = equivalent weight mass
	$W$ = mass deposited

From this law, it is clear that $96500$ coulomb of electricity gives one equivalent of any substance



## Application of Faraday's Laws

- It is used in electroplating of metals
- It is used in the extraction of several metals in pure form
- It is used in the separation of metals form non-metals
- It is used in preparation of compounds




# Electrochemical Cell

**An electrochemical cell is a device that can generate electrical energy from the chemical reactions occurring in it.** These devices are capable of converting chemical energy into electrical energy. Such cells are also called Galvanic-cells or Voltaic cells. Example: A standard 1.5 Volt battery.

![[Pasted image 20250217122222.png]]



## Single Electrode or Half-cell

An electrochemical cell consists of two electrodes (positive and negative). Each of these two electrode is known as half-cell or single electrode. Depending on the reaction occurring at the electrode, the single electrode is termed as anode or cathode. The electrode at which oxidation reaction (generation of electron, $M \rightarrow M^{n+} + ne^-$) takes place is called anode and the electrode at which reduction reaction (consumption of reaction, $M^{n+} + ne^- \rightarrow M$)  takes place is called cathode. As a result, there is continuous flow of electron from anode to cathode as long as the reaction goes on.

There are different types of single electrodes. Some of them are discussed below in brief.


### Metal-Metal Ion Electrode

These are the simplest and the most common types of electrode in which metal is submerged into a solution of its own ion containing salt. That is, in this type of electrode a metal is equilibrium with a solution of its own ion.

Example:
- $Zn$ in $ZnSO_4$ solution
- $Cu$ in $CuSO_4$ solution
- $Ag$ in $AgSO_4$ solution

These electrodes along with their reactions are represent as-

Electrodes when acts as anode

| Electrode          | Reactions                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| $Zn$/$Zn^{2+}(aq)$ | $Zn(s) \rightarrow Zn^{2+}(aq) + 2e^-$ |
| $Cu$/$Cu^{2+}(aq)$ | $Cu(s) \rightarrow Cu^{2+}(aq) + 2e^-$ |
| $Ag$/$Ag^+(aq)$    | $Ag(s) \rightarrow Ag^+(aq) + e^-$     |


Electrodes when acts as cathode

| Electrode          | Reactions                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| $Zn^{2+}(aq)$/$Zn$ | $Zn^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow Zn(s)$ |
| $Cu^{2+}(aq)$/$Cu$ | $Cu^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu(s)$ |
| $Ag^+(aq)$/$Ag$    | $Ag^+(aq) + e^- \rightarrow Ag(s)$     |



### Amalgam Electrode

There are some metals which are highly reactive, e.g., $Na$, $K$, $Cd$, $Pb$ etc. In such cases pure metals are too active to be used in aqueous solution of their own ions. Thus, in practice these metals are used as amalgam, i.e., as solutions of these metals in a less reactive metal usually mercury


## Notation of Electrochemical Cell

An electrochemical cell is the combination of two half cells. Each half cell is regarded as an electrode or single electrode. In representing an electrochemical cell and single electrode, Internationally accepted notations and conventions are used. The notations and conventions are briefly describe below

### The Interface

The interface between metal and electrolyte of an electrode is identified by a solid vertical line or oblique line, such as, $Ag$ | $Ag^+(aq)$ or $Ag$ / $Ag^+(aq)$. However, to avoid confusion arise in representing direct contact between two electrolytes of two half cells (by using a vertical line) in most cases oblique (/) line us preferably used


### Anode-Cathode

A half-cell represented in the sequence metal/electrolyte is anode i.e., oxidation reaction takes place at this electrode. Example: $Ag$ / $Ag^+$ is anode and oxidation reaction $Ag \rightarrow Ag^+ + e^-$ occurs here. One the other hand, a half-cell represent in the sequence electrolysis/metal is cathode i.e., reduction reaction takes place at this electrode. Example: $Ag^+$ / $Ag$ is cathode and reduction reactions $Ag^+ + e^- \rightarrow Ag$ occurs here.


### Contacts

The contact between (a) metal and insoluble salt of the metal, (b) metal and gas (in hydrogen electrode), (c) ions of two different oxidation states (in oxidation-reduction electrode) is presented by a comma (,) between them. Example:
- In calomel electrode: $Hg$, $Hg_2Cl_2$ / $Cl^-(aq)$
- In hydrogen electrode: $Pt$, $H_2(g)$ / $H^+(aq)$
- In oxidation reduction electrode: $Pt$ / $Fe^{2+},\ Fe^{3+}$ 


### Complete Cell

In representing a complete cell, the two electrodes of the cell are written side by side. Conventionally the anode is written in the left and the cathode is written in the right. For example. The Daniel cell is represented as
$$
Zn / Zn^{2+}(aq) || Cu^{2+}(aq) / Cu
$$


### Indirect and Direct Contact between Two Electrodes

The two vertical lines in the middle of the above Daniel cell indicates an indirect contact (salt bridge, paper stripe or porous partition) between electrolyte solutions. When the two electrolyte solution of a cell are in direct contact then a single vertical line is used between them. Example:
$$
Zn / Zn^{2+}(aq) | Cu^{2+}(aq) / Cu
$$


### Cell Reaction

A cell reaction is the sum of two single electrode reactions as they occur in the cell. The electrode at which oxidation reaction occurs is anode and the electrode at which reduction occurs is cathode


## The EMF

The total EMF of a cell is the algebraic sum of the corresponding single electrode potential


### Spontaneous Cell Reaction

If anode is written at the left and cathode at the right, then electron will flow from left to right through the external circuit. The cell EMF will be positive and the cell reaction is spontaneous. For example, EMF of Daniel cell is +1.10 Volt. However if we reverse the electrode the EMF becomes -1.10 Volt which is not spontaneous.


## Spontaneity and Free Energy

If the cell EMF is positive then the cell reaction would be spontaneous. From the thermodynamic point of view a spontaneous process or reaction is accompanied with the decrease in free energy. So,
$$
nFE = -\Delta G
$$



# Cell Reaction and Cell Potential

**Total cell reaction is the sum of the oxidation reaction at anode and the reduction reaction at cathode of the cell**

Similarly, **Cell Potential of an electrochemical cell is the sum of the corresponding individual single electrode potential**
$$
E_{cell} = E_{anode}^{oxidation} + E_{cathode}^{reduction}
$$

The cell reaction of the cell
$$
Zn / Zn^{2+}(aq) || Cu^{2+}(aq) / Cu
$$
The oxidation reaction at anode is $Zn(s) \rightarrow Zn^{2+}(aq) + 2e^-$
The reduction reaction at cathode is $Cu^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu(s)$
The cell reaction $Zn + Cu^{2+} \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + Cu$
Here the EMF would be,
$$
E_{cell} = E_{Zn / Zn^{2+}} + E_{Cu^{2+} / Cu}
$$

![[Pasted image 20250217143335.png]]

- In Daniel cell, electrons flow from zinc electrode to copper electrode through external circuit while metal ions flow from one half cell to the other through salt bridge
- Here current flows from copper electrode to zinc electrode that is, cathode to anode in external circuit
- Daniel cell is a reversible cell while a voltaic cell may be reversible or irreversible
- A voltaic cell is reversible only when it satisfies
	- The EMF of external source is more than that of voltaic cell so that current may flow from external source into the voltaic cell and cell reaction can be reversed
	- If EMF of voltaic cell is more than that of external source current flows from voltaic cell into external source


## Salt bridge

It maintains the electrical neutrality in two compartments by allowing movement of anions towards anodic compartment and cations towards cathodic compartment

- It is a glass tube having $KCl$, $KNO_3$, ammonium nitrate in a gelatin gel or agar-agar paste
- The gelatin gel allows ionic movement through it but prevents any kind of mixing
- In case of $KCl$ or ammonium nitrate, the ionic mobility of cation and anion are same

### Function of a salt bridge

- A salt bridge acts as an electrical contact between the two half-cells
- It prevents mechanical flow of solution but it provides free path for the migration of ions to maintain an electric current through the electrolyte solution. It prevents the accumulation of charges
- A salt bridge helps in maintaining the charge balance in the two half cells
- A salt bridge minimizes/eliminates the liquid junction potential

**Liquid Junction Potential:** The unequal rate of migration of the cations and anions across a liquid-liquid junction give rise to a potential different across the junction. This potential difference across the liquid-liquid junction is liquid junction potential


## Electrode Potential

The value of electrode potential of an electrode depend upon
- Temperature of they system
- Concentration of ions in solution
- Chemical nature of the metal or non metal
- Number of electrons transferred in the half cell reaction
- It does not depend upon length of electron


### Types of Electrode Potential


#### Oxidation Potential

When electrode is negatively charged with respect to solution then it acts as anode and oxidation takes place here.

![[Pasted image 20250217152034.png]]
$$
M \rightarrow M^{n+} + ne^-
$$
$$
E_{ox} = E_{ox}^o - \frac {2.303 RT} {nF} \log _{10}[M^{n+}]
$$
Here,
	Intercept = $E_{ox}^o$
	Slope = $- \frac {2.303 RT} {nF}$


#### Reduction Potential

When electrode is positively charged with respect to solution then it acts as cathode and reduction takes place here

![[Pasted image 20250217152539.png]]
$$
M^{n+} + ne^- \rightarrow M
$$
$$
E_{red} = E_{red}^o - \frac {2.303 RT} {nF} \log_{10} \left( \frac 1 {[M^{n+}]} \right)
$$
$$
E_{red} = E_{red}^o + \frac {2.303 RT} {nF} \log_{10} [M^{n+}]
$$
Here,
	Intercept = $E_{red}^o$
	Slope = $\frac {2.303 RT} {nF}$


## Calculation of the EMF of the Cell

Mathematically, it may be expressed as
$$
E_{cell}\ or\ EMF = E_{red}(cathode) - E_{red}(anode)
$$
$$
E_{cell}^o\ or\ EMF = E_{red}^o(cathode) - E_{red}^o(anode)
$$
- For cell reaction to occurs, the $E_{cell}$ should be positive. This can happen only if $E_{red}(cathode) > E_{red}(anode)$
- $E_{cell}^o$ must be positive for spontaneous reaction
- Rate of reaction is directly proportional to the EMF of the cell
- The EMF of the cell depends on the intensity of the reaction in the cell
- It measures free energy change for maximum convertibility of heat into useful work.
- It causes flow of current from higher value of $E^o$ electrode to lower $E^o$ value electrode



## EMF vs Cell Potential


| EMF                                                                                             | Cell Potential                                                                                   |

| It is measure by potentiometer                                                                  | It is measured by voltmeter                                                                      |
| It is the potential difference between two electrodes when no current is flowing in the circuit | It is the potential different between two electrodes when current is flowing through the circuit |
| IT is maximum voltage obtained from cell                                                        | It is less than maximum voltage                                                                  |
| It corresponds to maximum useful work obtained from galvanic cell                               | It does not correspond                                                                           |


## Nernst Equation

This equation gives the relationship between electrode potential and concentration of ions in the solution and shows the dependency of electrode potential on the concentration of the ions which the electrode is reversible

Form a single electrode involving reduction process,
$$
M^{n+} + ne^- \rightarrow M
$$
The Nernst equation is
$$
E = E^o - \frac {2.303 RT}{nF} \log_{10} \frac{[M]}{[M^{n+}]}
$$
at $25 \degree C$ or $298\ K$ 
$$
\frac {2.303 RT}{nF} = \frac {2.303 \times 8.314 \times 298}{n \times 96500} = \frac {0.0591} {n}
$$
Replacing the value in the equation we get
$$
E = E^o - \frac {0.0591}{n} \log_{10} \frac{[M]}{[M^{n+}]}
$$
Here,
	$T$ = Absolute temperature
	$E^o$ = EMF of the cell
	$E$ = Electrode potential of the cell
	$F$ = Faraday number
	$n$ = number of electrons transferred

- If electrode is solid its active mass is taken as 1
- For an electrochemical cell having net reaction
$$
xA + yB \xrightarrow[]{ne^-} mC + nD
$$
	The EMF can be calculated as
$$
E_{cell} = E_{cell}^o - \frac{0.0591}{n}log\frac{[C]^m[D]^n}{[A]^x[B]^y}
$$
Following facts should be kept in mind
- Concentration or activity of gases is expressed in terms in their partial pressures
- n, the number of electrons transferred should be calculated from the balanced net cell reaction
- Concentration or activity of solids in taken to to be unity


### Equilibrium Constant and Cell Potential

$$
E_{cell} = E_{cell}^o - \frac {0.0591}{n} \log_{10}Q
$$
At equilibrium
$E_{cell} = 0$, $Q = K$, Here $K$ is the equilibrium constant
Putting $E_{cell} = 0$ we get
$$
\log_{10} K = \frac{E^o_{cell} \cdot n}{0.0591}
$$


## Relationship between free energy change ($\Delta G$) and cell potential ($E$)

Electrical work done in one second is equal to electrical potential multiplied by total charge passed. If we want to obtain maximum work from a galvanic cell then charge has to be passed reversibly. The reversible work one by a galvanic cell is equal to the decrease in its Gibbs energy and there, if the EMF of the cell is $E$ and $nF$ is the amount of charge passed and $\Delta G$ is the Gibbs energy of the reaction then
$$
\Delta G = -nFE_{cell}
$$
for standard state conditions,
$$
\Delta G^o = -nFE^o_{cell}
$$


## Determination of pH

There are three ways to determine pH of a solution
- The hydrogen electrode
- The quinhydrone electrode
- The glass electrode

We will only discuss about the hydrogen electrode

![[Pasted image 20250217161949.png]]

A stand hydrogen electrode is coupled with another hydrogen electrode which contains the solution of unknown pH. In both half-cells hydrogen gas is used at 1 atm pressure and $25 \degree C$. The EMF of the complete cell
$$
Pt,\ H_2(1 atm) / H^+(1M)\ ||\ H^+(Unknown)\ | H_2(1atm),\ Pt
$$
The second electrode reaction is
$$
H^+ + e^- \rightleftharpoons \frac 12 H_2
$$
The electrode potential of the second half cell is given by the Nernst equation
$$
E = E^o + \frac {2.303 RT}{nF} \log \frac{[H^+]}{H_2^{\frac 12}}
$$
Since, $H_2^{\frac 12}$ = 1 and $E^o$ = 0, we have
$$
E = 0.0591 \log [H^+] = -0.0591pH
$$
The EMF of the total cell is
$$
E_{cell} = E_{right} - E_{left}
$$
As $E_{left}$ electrode is a S.H.E or Standard Hydrogen Electrode the value of the EMF of that electrode is 0
Hence,
$$
E_{cell} = 0 - (-0.591)pH
$$
$$
E_{cell} = 0.0591pH
$$
$$
or, pH = \frac{E_{cell}}{0.0591}
$$


# Over Potential / Over Voltage / Polarization

Over potential is the potential difference between a half-cell reaction's thermodynamically determined reduction potential and the experimentally observed potential

Four possible polarities of over potential

- The anode of an electrolytic cell is more positive. It needs more energy to drive the reaction
- The cathode of an electrolytic cell is more negative. It needs more energy to drive the reaction
- The anode of an electrochemical cell is less negative, supplying less energy than thermodynamic possible
- The cathode of an electrochemical cell is less positive, supplying less energy than thermodynamically possible


# Lithium Ion Battery

The lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery is the predominant commercial form of rechargeable battery, widely used in portable electronics and electrified transportation.

During a discharge cycle, lithium atoms in the anode are ionized and  separated from their electrons. The lithium ions move from the anode and pass through the electrolyte until they reach the cathode, where they recombine with their electrons and electrically neutralize. The lithium ions are small enough to be able to move through a micro-permeable separator between the anode and cathode. In part because of lithium's small atomic weight and radius (third only to hydrogen and helium), Li-ion batteries are capable of having a very high voltage and charge storage per unit mass and unit volume.

Li-ion batteries can use a number of different materials as electrodes. The most common combination is that of **lithium cobalt oxide (cathode) ($LiCoO_2$) and graphite (anode)**, which is used in commercial portable electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops. Other common cathode materials include lithium manganese oxide ($LiMn_2O_4$) (used in hybrid electric and electric automobiles) and lithium iron phosphate ($LiFePO_4$). Li-ion batteries typically use ether (a class of organic compounds) as an electrolyte.

Lithium ions are stored within graphite anodes through a mechanism known as intercalation, in which the ions are physically inserted between the 2D layers of graphene that make up bulk graphite. The size of the ions relative to the layered carbon lattice means that graphite anodes are not physically warped by charging or discharging, and the strength of the carbon-carbon bonds relative to the weak interactions between the Li ions and the electrical charge of the anode make the insertion reaction highly reversible

![[Pasted image 20250218012813.png]]

- Safety: Li-ion batteries can overheat and catch fire under certain conditions
- Cost: The high cost of lithium can make Li-ion batteries expensive.
- Environmental impact: The mining of lithium and other materials can have environmental consequences




# Fuel Cell

A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts the chemical energy of a fuel (often hydrogen) and an oxidizing agent (often oxygen) into electricity through electrochemical (pair of redox) reaction.

A fuel cell can be defined as an electrochemical cell that generates electrical energy from fuel via an electrochemical reaction similar to a battery. However, unlike a battery, a fuel cell doesn't need recharging. It produces electricity continuously as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied.

Fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for commercial, industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas. They are also used to power fuel cell vehicles,  including forklifts, automobiles, buses, trains, boats, motorcycles, and submarines.

A fuel cell is similar to electrochemical cells, which consists of a cathode, an anode, and an electrolyte. In fuel cells the electrolytes enables the movement of the protons.



## Working Principle of Fuel Cell

The reaction between hydrogen and oxygen is used to generate electricity via a fuel cell. The working of this fuel cell involved the passing of hydrogen and oxygen into a concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide via carbon electrodes. The reaction can be written as follows:

Cathode Reaction: $O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^- \rightarrow 4OH^-$
Anode Reaction: $2H_2 + 4OH^- \rightarrow 4H_2O + 4e^-$
Net Cell Reaction: $2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O$

However, the reaction rate of this electrochemical reaction is quite low. This issues is overcome with the help of a catalyst such as platinum or palladium. In order to increase the effective surface area, the catalyst is finely divided before begin incorporated into the electrodes.

![[Pasted image 20250218014731.png]]


## How Fuel Cells Work

Fuel cells work like batteries, but they do not run down or need recharging. They produce electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied. A fuel cell consists of two electrodes - a negative electrode or anode and a positive electrode or cathode - sandwiched around an electrolyte.  A fuel, such as hydrogen, is fed to the anode, and air is fed to the cathode. In a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, a catalyst separates hydrogen atoms into protons and electrons, which take different paths to the cathode. The electrons go through an external circuit, creating a flow of electricity. The protons migrate through the electrolyte to the cathode, where they reunite with oxygen and the electrons to produce water and heat

**Polymer Chemistry is the sub discipline of chemistry that focus on the structure of molecules, macro molecules and chemical properties and synthesis of macro molecules.**

Polymer are called macro molecules,

**Polymer is a giant molecule made up from a large number of repeating units (-mer)**. Such as polyethylene which may contain 100 or more ethylene monomer unit.

**Polymerization:** Is the process of formation of polymer, that is the process of formation of large molecules from small molecules.

**Monomer:** is the type of molecule which has the ability to bond with another molecule to form the macro molecule

Example:

**Oligomer:** A polymer containing very few repeating unit (2 - 10) is called oligomer

**General Types of Polymer**
1. Natural Polymer: Found in animal and plant. Example: Protein, Starch, Cellulose, Biodegradable material
2. Synthetic Polymer: Man made polymer. Example: Plastic
3. Linear Polymer: Pipe, Cable. The repeating unit form linear chain
4. Branch Chain Polymer: Linear but contains branch (polythene)
5. Cross-linked Polymer: Cross linked forms when the functional group is bifunctional or trifunctional or more (melamine)
6. Thermosetting Polymer
	- Irreversible process
	- Hardening
	- Example: Polyester
7. Thermoplastic Polymer
	- Softening (after providing heat, they are cooled down)
	- Nylon, Teflon



# Polymerization


There are three ways to form a polymer or of polymerization
- Step Growth - Defined as condensation
- Ring Growth
- Chain Growth - Defines as addition

We are only going to discuss about step growth and chain growth

## Step Growth Polymerization

- Also known as condensation
- Poly functional group is needed
- Generally follows a step-by-step process
- By-product is created in the process

**Step growth is a process of polymerization where the functional group plays the major role and by-product is created**

Usually two types of monomer acts in this kind of polymerization, one is dicarboxylic acid monomer and the other is diol monomer

Dicarboxylic acid gives off it's $OH$ and diol gives off it's $H$ to form $H_2O$, and create the following dimer in the process

The point at which both monomer links is called the ester link

This process is repeated multiple times creating a polymer in the process

important thing to note is
1. Each of the monomers has to have at least two functional groups![[Pasted image 20250220170745.png]]
2. 2 different function groups overall
3. Small molecule given off in the process

Polyesters are generally biodegradable which makes them different from addition polymer as they are generally non-biodegradable.


## Chain Growth Polymerization

- Also known as addition polymer

In addition polymer, multiple reactants make a single product without any by-product in the process

Addition polymer is completed in three steps
1. Initiation
2. Propagation
3. Termination

Generally, unsaturated Carbon compounds show addition polymer formation
Example:

$R^*$ = Highly reactive radical

**Important Uses of Polymers**

1. **Packaging:** Polymers like polyethylene and polypropylene are used in plastic bags, bottles, and food containers due to their lightweight and barrier properties
2. **Textiles:** Synthetic fibers such as polyester, nylon, and acrylic are used in clothing, carpets, and upholstery
3. **Construction:** Polymers like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are used in pipes, insulation, and window frames due to their durability and resistance to corrosion
4. **Automotive:** Polymers are used in car parts such as bumpers, dashboards, and tired to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency


**Key Properties of Polymers**

Polymers exhibit a wide range of properties that make them suitable for diverse application. Some of the most important properties are
1. Lightweight
2. Durable
3. Flexible
4. Insulator
5. Biocompatible

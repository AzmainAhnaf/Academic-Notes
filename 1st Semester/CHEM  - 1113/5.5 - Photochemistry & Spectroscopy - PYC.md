4. Show the types of electronic transitions in propanone and discuss the types of shifting take place for electronic transitions in propanone in presence of polar and non-polar solvents
   
   Propanone (acetone, $CH_3COCH_3$) is a simple organic molecule that exhibits electronic transition in the UV region. The primary electronic transition in propanone involve the carbonyl group ($C = O$), which is a key chromophore in the molecule
   
   Propanone undergoes two main types of electronic transitions. $n \rightarrow \pi^*$, this transition involves the promotion of a non-bonding electron from oxygen atom of the carbonyl group to the antibonding $\pi^*$ orbital of the $C=O$ bond and $\pi \rightarrow \pi^*$, this transition involves the promotion of an electron from the bonding $\pi$ orbital of the $C = O$ bond to the antibonding $\pi^*$ orbital.
   
   The absorption wavelength ($\lambda_{max}$) of electronic transitions in propanone can shift depending on the polarity of the solvent. A bathochromic shift occurs when the absorption maximum moves to a longer wavelength (lower energy). This shift is typically observed for $\pi \rightarrow \pi^*$ transitions in polar solvents and $n \rightarrow \pi^*$ in non polar solvents. A hypsochromic shift occurs when the absorption maximum moves to a shorter wavelength (higher energy). This shift is typically observed for $n \rightarrow \pi^*$ transitions in polar solvents.
   
5. With an increase of conjugation in carbonyl group, it experiences bathochromic shift. Explain with specific example
   
   The bathochromic shift or red shift refers to the shift of an absorption maximum to a longer wavelength (lower energy) due to change in the molecular structure or environment. In case of carbonyl compounds, an increase in conjugation leads to a bathochromic shift because the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state decreases. Conjugation involves the overlap of p-orbitals across alternating single and double bonds, which delocalizes electrons and stabilizes the molecule. In carbonyl compounds, conjugation lowers the energy of the $\pi^*$ antibonding orbital and raises the energy of the $\pi$ bonding orbital, reducing the energy gap between them, which lead to a smaller energy gap which corresponds to a longer wavelength of absorption.

5. Explain why $O_2$ is paramagnetic but $N_2$ is diamagnetic

	Molecular orbit diagram for $O_2$ is
	![[Pasted image 20250223050935.png]]
	
	Here, the antibonding $\pi$ orbitals are each occupied by one electron. These two electrons remain unpaired due to Hund's rule, which state that the electron will occupy degenerate orbitals singly before pairing up. Unpaired electrons contribute to a net magnetic moment, making $O_2$ paramagnetic.
	
	Molecular Orbital diagram for $N_2$ is
	![[Pasted image 20250223051254.png]]
	
	$N_2$ has no unpaired electron as a result $N_2$ is diamagnetic.


6. Discuss the shape of $H_2O$ molecule

	In $H_2O$, oxygen has 2 bonding pairs that form the $O-H$ bond and 2 lone pairs. According to VSEPR, repulsion force between lone pair and lone pair is greater than that of bond pair and bond pair. In an ideal tetrahedral arrangement, the bond angle is $109.5 \degree$. $H_2O$ is a tetrahedral as it's hybridization is $SP_3$ and as it has two lone pair it slightly bend so it's bond angle is $104.5 \degree$

# 20 Series

1. Compare the properties of electrovalent and covalent compounds
2. Establish an equation for heat of formation of $FeCl_3$ with illustration of the Born-Haber cycle
3. Explain why the lattice energy of $MgCl_2$ is so much greater than $NaCl$
   
   In $NaCl$, the ions are $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$, with charges of +1 and -1 respectively. In $MgCl_2$, the ions are $Mg^{2+}$ and $Cl^-$, with charges of +2 and -1 respectively
   
   The lattice energy is directly proportional to the product of the charges of the ions. Since $Mg^{2+}$ has a higher charge than $Na^+$, the electrostatic attraction between $Mg^{2+}$ and $Cl^-$ is much stronger than between $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$. This results in a significantly higher lattice energy for $MgCl_2$
   
   Also, the ionic radius of $Mg^{2+}$ is smaller than that of $Na^+$. Smaller ions can pack more closely together in the lattice, increasing the electrostatic attraction between them
   
   Since $Mg^{2+}$ is smaller than $Na^+$, the distance between $Mg^{2+}$ and $Cl^-$ in $MgCl_2$ is shorter than the distance between $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$ in $NaCl$. The shorter distance in $MgCl_2$ leads to a stronger attraction and higher lattice energy.

# 19 Series

1. What do you mean by electrovalent bond? Explain the condition of formation of ionic bond
2. Explain the followings:
   - $SiCl_4$ is easily hydrolyzed by $H_2O$ but $CCl_4$ is not
   - $H_2O$ boils at much higher temperature than $H_2S$
     
     $SiCl_4$ undergoes hydrolysis readily because silicon has vacant 3d orbitals in its valence shell. These d-orbitals can accept lone pairs of electrons from water ($H_2O$), facilitating the hydrolysis reaction.
     $SiCl_4 + 4H_2O \rightarrow Si(OH)_4 + 4HCl$
     
     $CCL_4$ does not undergo hydrolysis because carbon does not have vacant d-orbitals in its valence shell and there is a strong bond between $C-Cl$ which prevents water from reacting with it.
     
     $H_2O$ has a very high boiling point compared to $H_2S$ due to hydrogen bond. Water molecules form strong hydrogen bonds between highly electronegative oxygen atom of one molecule and the hydrogen atom of another molecule. As hydrogen bonds are much stronger than other intermolecular forces, the boiling point of $H_2O$ becomes very high compared to $H_2S$, which does not contain hydrogen bond in it.

1. Define salt bridge. Describe its function in an electrochemical cell
   
   A salt bridge is a device used in electrochemical cells to maintain electrical neutrality by allowing the flow of ions between the two half-cells. It maintain the electrical neutrality in two compartments by allowing movements of anions towards anodic compartment and cations towards cathodic compartment.
   
   Functions:
   - A salt bridge acts as an electrical contact between two half-cells
   - It prevent mechanical flow of solution but it provides free for the migration of ions to maintain an electric current through the electrolyte solution. It prevents the accumulation of charges
   - A salt bridge helps in maintaining the charge balance in two half-cells
   - A salt bridge minimizes/eliminates the liquid junction potential.
   
2. Explain the following
   - $Zn$ gives $H_2$ gas when it reacts with $H_2SO_4$ but $Ag$ does not.
   - Which is the best oxidizing agent between $Cu$ and $Zn$ and why?
     $E^0_{Zn^{2+}/Zn}$ = -0.76V, $E^0_{Ag^+/Ag}$ = 0.80V and $E^0_{Cu^{2+}/Cu}$ = 0.34V
     
     **Why $Zn$ gives $H_2$ gas when it reacts with $H_2SO_4$, but $Ag$ does not**
     
     This behavior is due to the reactivity of the metals and their positions in the electrochemical series. The electrochemical series ranks metals based on their tendency to lost electrons (oxidize) or gain electrons (reduce)
     
     $Zn$ is a reactive metal and lies above hydrogen in the electrochemical series. It's standard reduction potential is -0.76V, which means it has a strong tendency to lose electrons and oxidize. When $Zn$ reacts with $H_2SO_4$, it displaces hydrogen from the acid because $Zn$ is more reactive than hydrogen
     $$ Zn + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow ZnSO_4 + H_2 \uparrow $$
     Here, $Zn$ oxidizes to $Zn^{2+}$, and $H^+$ ions from the acid reduce to $H_2$ gas
     
     $Ag$ is a less reactive material and lies below hydrogen in electrochemical series. Its standard reduction potential is +0.80V ,which means it has a low tendency to lose electrons and oxidize. $Ag$ cannot displace hydrogen from $H_2SO_4$ because it is less reactive than hydrogen. Therefore, no $H_2$ gas is produced when $Ag$ reacts with $H_2SO_4$
     
     **Which is the better oxidizing agent between $Cu$ and $Zn$, and why?**
     
     An oxidizing agent is a substance that gains electrons and causes another substance to lose electrons. The strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential($E^0$). The higher the $E^0$, the stronger the oxidizing agent.

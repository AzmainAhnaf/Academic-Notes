# Structure of Matter

The state of the matter can be classified as the following tree
- Solid
- Fluid
	- Liquid
	- Gas

## Basic Properties of Solid
- Incompressible
- Inflexible
- Have mechanical Strength
- Have specific shape


## Types of Solid

Solid can be classified into following three categories
1. Crystalline Solids
2. Poly-crystalline Solids
3. Non-crystalline Solids (amorphous)


### Crystalline Solid

**The constituents of the solid (atoms, molecules, or ions) are arranged in an orderly manner in a definite geometric shape.**

**Lattice:** Regular and periodic arrangement of point in space

**Basis:** Atom or group of atoms

Lattice and basis forms crystal together.

**Analogy:** in a classroom (crystal), lattice are the empty benches where student will sit and the student/s are the lattice. Empty benches and student/s forms a classroom.

**Example:** Diamonds, $NaCl$, $KCl$, Metals.



### Poly-Crystalline Solid

**Occur on powder resemble amorphous but properties are just like crystalline solids.**

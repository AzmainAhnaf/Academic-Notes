# Electronics
and its purpose

- Sub-branch of electrical engineering
- Creation, manipulation and control of conduction in semiconductors
- Physics, engineering and technology of semiconductor devices and their applications in signal processing
- Example: rectification, amplification etc.


# Semiconductor

**Definition:** Materials having conductivity in between conductors and insulators are called semiconductor. Example: $Ge$, $Si$, $GaAs$ etc.

## Types of Semiconductor

1. Intrinsic Semiconductor
	- Semiconductor in its pure form
	- Level of purity, 1:10000000000 (one in 10 billion)
	- Carriers present in such materials is called intrinsic carriers, due to photo-ionization and thermal-ionization
	- Bonding of atoms strengthen by the sharing of electrons.
2. Extrinsic Semiconductor
	- Semiconductors subjected to doping process
	- Extrinsic semiconductors are of p and n types
